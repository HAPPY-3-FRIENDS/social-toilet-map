# SOCIAL TOILET MAP - GRADUATION CAPSTONE PROJECT

:wave: Welcome to our Graduation Capstone Project - Social Toilet Map :wave:

> Perhaps there are plenty of shortcomings, perhaps numerous challenges, conflicts, but please allow us to encapsulate this journey in three words: effort, gratitude and pride.
> 
> First and foremost, we would like to express our gratitude to Mr. Kieu Trong Khanh, our cherished (and occasionally terrifying) supervisor, for his invaluable advice, knowledge and motivation. His dedication is one of the most important sources of inspiration for our team as we work to finish the project.
>
> We want to demonstrate our gratitude to the reviewers for their insightful criticism, which enabled us to identify our weaknesses and present the best solutions for the project. We are also grateful to FPT University for this excellent opportunity.
>
> We would like to say our heartfelt thanks to our family for their ongoing support, encouragement, and care for our physical and mental well-being throughout the project's execution. Additionally, we are keen to send a message of appreciation to anybody who assisted us with our graduation project in any way, whether directly or indirectly.
>
> We are grateful to ourselves again for cooperating to complete this project. Thank ourselves for always being there as we jointly create the Social Toilet Map, something we have always desired.
> 
> Best of luck, </br>
> Social Toilet Map Team
